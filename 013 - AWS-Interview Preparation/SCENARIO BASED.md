**Answer:** I would use AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) to manage user access across multiple AWS accounts. By configuring SSO integrations, users can access multiple accounts securely without needing separate credentials.

### 14. **Scenario:** Your company is aiming for high availability by deploying applications across multiple regions. How could you implement global traffic distribution?
**Answer:** I would use Amazon Route 53 with Latency-Based Routing or Geolocation Routing to direct traffic to the closest or most appropriate region based on user location.

### 15. **Scenario:** Your application is generating a significant amount of logs. How could you centralize log management and enable efficient analysis?
**Answer:** I would use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to centralize log storage and AWS CloudWatch Logs Insights to query and analyze logs efficiently, making it easier to troubleshoot and monitor application behavior.

### 16. **Scenario:** Your application needs to store and retrieve large amounts of unstructured data. How could you design a cost-effective solution?
**Answer:** I would use Amazon S3 with appropriate storage classes (such as S3 Standard or S3 Intelligent-Tiering) based on data access patterns. This allows for durable and cost-effective storage of unstructured data.

### 17. **Scenario:** Your team wants to enable automated testing for infrastructure deployments. How could you achieve this?
**Answer:** I would integrate AWS CloudFormation StackSets into the CI/CD pipeline. StackSets allow you to deploy infrastructure templates to multiple accounts and regions, enabling automated testing of infrastructure changes.

### 18. **Scenario:** Your application uses AWS Lambda functions, and you want to improve cold start performance. How could you address this challenge?
**Answer:** I would implement an Amazon API Gateway with the HTTP proxy integration, creating a warm-up endpoint that periodically invokes Lambda functions to keep them warm.

### 19. **Scenario:** Your application has multiple microservices, each with its own database. How could you manage database schema changes efficiently?
**Answer:** I would use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) to replicate data between the old and new schema versions, allowing for seamless database migrations without disrupting application operations.

### 20. **Scenario:** Your organization is concerned about data protection and compliance. How could you ensure sensitive data is securely stored and transmitted?
**Answer:** I would use Amazon S3 server-side encryption and Amazon RDS encryption at rest for data storage. For data transmission, I would use SSL/TLS encryption for communication between services and implement security best practices.

### 21. **Scenario:** Your application needs to process real-time streaming data. How could you design a scalable and efficient solution?
