# Project 4: Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and AWS EC2


## Create a Terraform configuration file that defines the desired infrastructure:

+ Create a new directory for the Terraform configuration files.

+ Create a new file called main.tf and specify the desired infrastructure (e.g. EC2 instance, security group, key pair).

## Use Terraform to apply the configuration file and provision the infrastructure in AWS:

+ Install Terraform on your local machine or a separate server.

+ Authenticate Terraform with your AWS account and configure the necessary AWS permissions.

+ Run the "terraform init" command to initialize the Terraform configuration.

+ Run the "terraform apply" command to apply the Terraform configuration and provision the infrastructure in AWS.

## Use Terraform to update the infrastructure as necessary:

+ Modify the main.tf file to update the infrastructure configuration as necessary (e.g. change the instance type, add new security rules).

+ Run the "terraform apply" command again to update the infrastructure in AWS.
