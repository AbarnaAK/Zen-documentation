# Project 7: Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerting with AWS CloudWatch

## 1.  Create an AWS EC2 instance and install a sample application that generates logs:

+ Create a new EC2 instance with the necessary security groups and key pairs.

+ Install a sample application that generates logs (e.g. Apache web server).

## 2.  Configure CloudWatch to monitor the logs and trigger alerts based on predefined metrics:

+ Create a new CloudWatch log group and specify the log stream from the sample application.

+ Define custom CloudWatch metrics based on the log data and set thresholds for alerting.

+ Configure CloudWatch alarms to trigger notifications (e.g. email, SMS) when the thresholds are breached.

## Test the monitoring and alerting by simulating a scenario that triggers the alert (e.g. overwhelming traffic to the application).
