# Project 3: Continuous Integration for a Node.js Application using Git, Jenkins, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Create a sample Node.js application with source code in a Git repository:

+ Create a new Git repository and clone it to your local machine.

+ Create a new Node.js application with a package.json file and source code files.

+ Add and commit the files to the Git repository.

## Configure Jenkins to clone the Git repository, install dependencies, run tests, and package the application as a ZIP file:

+ Install Jenkins on a separate server or locally.

+ Install the necessary plugins for Node.js, Git, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

+ Create a new Jenkins job and configure it to pull the source code from the Git repository, install dependencies, run tests, and package the application as a ZIP file.

## Configure Jenkins to transfer the ZIP file to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using the Elastic Beanstalk plugin:

+ Configure the Elastic Beanstalk plugin in Jenkins to authenticate with your AWS account and specify the target Elastic Beanstalk environment.

+ Add a post-build action to the Jenkins job to transfer the ZIP file to Elastic Beanstalk.

## Set up Elastic Beanstalk to deploy the application and automatically scale the environment based on traffic:

+ Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment with the Node.js platform and select the ZIP file to deploy.

+ Configure the environment to automatically scale based on traffic using Elastic Beanstalk's auto-scaling feature.
