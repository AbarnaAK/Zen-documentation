# Project 8: Infrastructure Automation with AWS Lambda

##  Create a sample AWS S3 bucket and define an event trigger that calls a Lambda function:

+ Create a new S3 bucket with the necessary permissions.

+ Define a new event trigger that calls a Lambda function when a new object is uploaded to the bucket.

## Create a Lambda function that automates a predefined task (e.g. resizing images, encrypting files, copying files to another location):

+ Create a new Lambda function and specify the code and configuration (e.g. runtime, memory size).

+ Implement the necessary logic to automate the predefined task (e.g. use an image resizing library to resize images).

## Test the automation by uploading files to the S3 bucket and verifying that the Lambda function is triggered and automates the predefined task.
