# Project 6: Setting up a Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Git, Jenkins, Docker, and AWS ECS

## Create a sample application with a Dockerfile:

+ Create a new directory for the application files.

+ Create a new Dockerfile that specifies the application dependencies and configuration.

## Configure Jenkins to build the Docker image, push it to a Docker registry, and deploy it to AWS ECS:

+ Install Jenkins on a separate server or locally.

+ Install the necessary plugins for Docker and AWS ECS.

+ Create a new Jenkins job and configure it to build the Docker image, push it to a Docker registry, and deploy it to AWS ECS.

## Set up AWS ECS to run the Docker container and automatically scale the service based on traffic:

+ Create a new ECS cluster and task definition that specifies the Docker image to run.

+ Create a new ECS service that runs the task definition and automatically scales based on traffic.

+ Test the pipeline by making changes to the application code and verifying that the changes are automatically deployed to the production environment.
