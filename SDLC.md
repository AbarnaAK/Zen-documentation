# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured framework used in software engineering to guide the development process of software applications. It consists of several phases, each with specific objectives and deliverables.

## Phases of SDLC:

### 1. Planning
In the planning phase, project goals, requirements, and constraints are defined. This involves gathering business requirements, conducting feasibility studies, and creating a project plan.

### 2. Design
The design phase involves creating a blueprint for the software. This includes system architecture, database design, user interface design, and other technical specifications.

### 3. Development
In the development phase, actual coding of the software takes place. Programmers write code according to the design specifications and follow coding standards.

### 4. Testing
Testing is a crucial phase where the software is evaluated for defects, bugs, and compliance with requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

### 5. Deployment
Once the software passes testing, it is deployed for end-users. This may involve installation on servers, distribution through app stores, or other deployment methods.

### 6. Maintenance
After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This involves addressing user feedback, fixing bugs, making updates, and ensuring the software remains functional.

# Agile Methodology

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.

## Key Principles of Agile:

1. **Individuals and Interactions:** Prioritize face-to-face communication and collaboration within the team.

2. **Working Software:** Focus on delivering functional software in small increments, rather than extensive documentation.

3. **Customer Collaboration:** Involve customers in the development process to gather feedback and adapt to changing requirements.

4. **Responding to Change:** Embrace changes in requirements, even late in the development process, to deliver a better product.

# Scrum Framework

Scrum is a popular Agile framework that organizes work into small, time-bound iterations called sprints.

## Roles in Scrum:

### Product Owner
The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and is responsible for defining and prioritizing the features or user stories that need to be developed.

### Scrum Master
The Scrum Master facilitates the Scrum process, helps the team remove impediments, and ensures that Scrum practices are followed.

### Development Team
The Development Team is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and delivering increments of product functionality.

## Scrum Artifacts:

### Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is a dynamic list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes prioritized by business value.

### Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is a subset of items from the Product Backlog selected for implementation in the current sprint.

### Increment
The Increment is the sum of all completed items from previous sprints, providing a potentially shippable product.

## Scrum Events:

### Sprint Planning
At the beginning of each sprint, the team plans the work to be done during the sprint, selecting items from the Product Backlog.

### Daily Scrum
A short daily meeting where team members synchronize their work and plan for the day.

### Sprint Review
At the end of each sprint, the team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders for feedback.

### Sprint Retrospective
A reflection meeting at the end of each sprint to discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to implement those improvements.
