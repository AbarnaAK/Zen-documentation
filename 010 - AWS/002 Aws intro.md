## · What is Internet: 
A global computer network using standardized 
communication protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP/IP) providing information and 
communication facilities.
·
## Local Network: 
Private network in LAN (Local Area Network)

## · Virtualization: 
Run multiple OSs on a host machine (Type 1: BareMetal, Uses Hypervisor OS (e.g. ESXi) and Type 2: Application running on another base OS (e.g. vmware workstation)).

## Virtual Machine:
Software representation of virtual computer as set of files! Easy 
to move, independent of hardware, Effective utilization of resources. We can do 
virtual networking between VMs.

## · Data Center: 
Data centers are simply centralized locations where computing and 
networking equipment is concentrated for the purpose of collecting, storing, 
processing, distributing or allowing access to large amounts of data.
· What is Cloud? There is now Cloud, it is someone else's computer accessible over the Internet! Virtual Machine running on a cloud server is the most widely used way of hosting any applications online.

## · Cloud Computing:

The term cloud refers to a network or the internet. It is a technology that uses remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and access data online rather than local drives. The data can be anything such as files, images, documents, audio, video, and more.

## These are the following operations that we can do using cloud computing:

<ol><li>Developing new applications and services</li>
 <li>Storage, back up, and recovery of data</li>
<li> Hosting blogs and websites</li>
 <li>Delivery of software on demand</li>
 <li>Analysis of data</li>
 <li>Streaming videos and audios</li>
</ol>




## What is Amazon Web Services (AWS)?
![Group-169-3](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/36299748/175de7b4-af2c-46ef-8dea-6d8cf3ab915a)

+ Applications like YouTube, Gmail, Facebook are software that are hosted on cloud. Those are often called Software as a Services (SaaS).
 Amazon Web Services is a public cloud provider, a gigantic pool of configurable resources (Servers, Storage, Networks, etc.) spanned across multiple Data Centers in the globe where you can deploy your infrastructure/ applications. Hence it is also called Infrastructure as a Services (IaaS).
 
+ IaaS – Entire Infrastructure provided to you as a fully managed service
Rapid provisioning and release of the resources.
Resources are elastic in nature; you can scale up and scale down the resources. (Scaling: Ability to change an implementation to respond to changing traffic patterns.). e.g. During Black Friday sale, services may require more compute power.

+ You can build could apps/ software (SaaS) using AWS (IaaS). Services can be used On-demand and Pay as you Go fashion (Like our Electricity bill, pay for the usage).
 We can gradually move services to Cloud (On-Ramp), some of the services are moved to cloud, often called Hybrid Cloud.
 
+ AWS follows strict regulations that allows Banking, Research sectors to move their infrastructure to cloud.
The collective money that we pay to Amazon, enables them to maintain the Data Centers all over the world.
Examples AWS Solutions: amazon.com, Netflix, etc. uses AWS in the backend. 


# Benefits of AWS:

**Scalability:** AWS allows you to scale your resources up or down based on demand, ensuring that you pay for only what you use.

**Reliability:**  AWS offers a highly reliable infrastructure, with multiple data centers and built-in redundancy to minimize downtime.

**Security:**  AWS provides extensive security measures to protect your data, including encryption, access controls, and network firewalls.

**Cost-effective:** With AWS, you can avoid large upfront costs for hardware and infrastructure and pay for resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.

**Global Infrastructure:** AWS has a vast global infrastructure with data centers located in multiple regions worldwide, allowing you to deploy your applications closer to your end-users for improved performance.

# AWS Services:

**Compute:**  AWS provides various compute services, including Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for virtual servers, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and AWS Batch for batch computing.


**Storage:**  AWS offers multiple storage options, such as Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) for object storage, Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) for block storage, and Amazon Glacier for long-term archival storage.


**Database:**  AWS provides managed database services like Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL databases, and Amazon Redshift for data warehousing.


**Networking:**  AWS offers services like Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for creating isolated virtual networks, AWS Direct Connect for dedicated network connections, and Amazon Route 53 for DNS management.


**Security and Identity:**  AWS provides services like AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) for user access control, AWS Secrets Manager for secure secrets storage, and AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

**Analytics:**  AWS offers services for data analytics and business intelligence, including Amazon Athena for query analysis, Amazon Redshift for data warehousing, and Amazon QuickSight for visualization.

**AI and Machine Learning:**  AWS provides AI and ML services like Amazon SageMaker for building ML models, Amazon Rekognition for image and video analysis, and Amazon Comprehend for natural language processing.

**Management Tools:**  AWS offers various tools for managing your infrastructure, including AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code, AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging, and AWS Systems Manager for automating operational tasks.

## Getting Started with AWS:

**Create an AWS Account:**  Start by creating an AWS account on the AWS website (https://aws.amazon.com/) and provide the necessary billing and contact information.

**Choose a Region:**  Select the AWS region where you want to deploy your resources. Each region consists of multiple data centers.

**Access Management:**  Set up AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage user access and permissions.

**Launch Instances:**  Launch virtual servers (EC2 instances) or leverage serverless computing with AWS Lambda to run your applications.

**Store Data:**  Use storage services like Amazon S3 or databases like Amazon RDS to store and manage your data.

**Explore Additional Services:**  Discover and explore other AWS services that can enhance your application, such as networking, security, analytics, and AI/ML.

**Pay-as-you-go Pricing:**  Understand and monitor your resource usage to optimize costs and take advantage of AWS's pay-as-you-go pricing model."
