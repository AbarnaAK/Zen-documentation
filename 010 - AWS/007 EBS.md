# Amazon Elastic Block Storage

![Amazon-EBS](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/77039703/36f8194e-e317-4562-b9dd-3c034d36a6fd)

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. 

EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices.mazon EBS for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. 

EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the primary storage for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage.

## Amazon EBS volumes

+ Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach to your instances.

+ After you attach a volume to an instance, you can use it as you would use a physical hard drive. EBS volumes are flexible.

+ For current-generation volumes attached to current-generation instance types, you can dynamically increase size, modify the provisioned IOPS capacity, and change volume type on live production volumes.


## Amazon EBS Volume types:

EBS provides different volume types to meet various performance and cost requirements:

 **General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3):** Provides a balance of price and performance for a wide 
range of workloads.

**Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2):** Offers high-performance storage with customizable IOPS 
(Input/Output Operations Per Second) to meet demanding I/O requirements.

**Throughput Optimized HDD (st1):** Optimized for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive 
workloads, such as big data, data warehouses, and log processing.

**Cold HDD (sc1):** Designed for less frequently accessed workloads, offering low-cost storage 
for large volumes of data.

## Benefits of using EBS volumes

EBS volumes provide benefits that are not provided by instance store volumes.

1.Data availability

2.Data persistence

3.Data encryption

4.Data security

5.Snapshots

6.Flexibility

## Snapshots

+ Amazon EBS provides the ability to create snapshots (backups) of any EBS volume and write a copy of the data in the volume to Amazon S3, where it is stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones.

+ The volume does not need to be attached to a running instance in order to take a snapshot.

+ As you continue to write data to a volume, you can periodically create a snapshot of the volume to use as a baseline for new volumes.

+ These snapshots can be used to create multiple new EBS volumes or move volumes across Availability Zones. Snapshots of encrypted EBS volumes are automatically encrypted.

+ Snapshots are incremental backups, meaning that only the blocks on the volume that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved.

## Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager

Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs. When you automate snapshot and AMI management, it helps you to:

+ Protect valuable data by enforcing a regular backup schedule.

+ Create standardized AMIs that can be refreshed at regular intervals.

+ Retain backups as required by auditors or internal compliance.

+ Reduce storage costs by deleting outdated backups.

+ Create disaster recovery backup policies that back up data to isolated Regions or accounts.

## Quotas

Your AWS account has the following quotas related to Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager:

Custom lifecycle policies per Region -100

Default policies for EBS snapshots per Region	-1

Default policies for EBS-backed AMIs per Region	-1

Tags per resource	-45


## Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes

+ Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes, you can increase the volume size, change the volume type, or adjust the performance of your EBS volumes.

+ If your instance supports Elastic Volumes, you can do so without detaching the volume or restarting the instance.

+ This enables you to continue using your application while the changes take effect.

+ There is no charge to modify the configuration of a volume. You are charged for the new volume configuration after volume modification starts. 

## Instance storage

+ Instance storage, also known as ephemeral storage, refers to the temporary block-level storage that is directly attached to an Amazon EC2 instance.

+ It provides high-performance, low-latency storage that is ideal for certain types of workloads.

![instance_storage](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/77039703/e02e12b1-a091-46f6-b730-b382b7bba17b)


## Here are some key points about instance storage:

**1. Physical Disks:** Instance storage is typically comprised of physical disks that are physically attached to the host machine running the EC2 instance. These disks are not network attached storage like Amazon EBS but are instead directly connected to the instance.


**2. Performance:** Instance storage offers excellent performance characteristics, including high IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) and low latency. Since it is directly attached to the instance, there is minimal network overhead, allowing for fast read and write operations.


**3. Temporary Storage:** Instance storage is considered ephemeral or temporary storage because its data does not persist if the EC2 instance is stopped, terminated, or experiences an underlying hardware failure. When the instance is stopped or terminated, the data stored on the instance storage is lost.


**4. Instance Store Volumes:** Instance storage is presented to EC2 instances as instance store volumes. These volumes can be used as raw block devices or formatted with a file system. The available instance store volumes and their sizes vary depending on the EC2 instance type.


**5. Use Cases:** Instance storage is suitable for workloads that require high-performance, temporary storage, such as caching, temporary file storage, batch processing, and high performance databases. It can be used to store frequently accessed data, intermediate results, or transient data that can be regenerated if lost.


**6. Instance Store Metadata:** Each EC2 instance with instance store volumes also has associated instance store metadata. This metadata provides information about the available instance store volumes and their mount points on the instance.


It's important to note that instance storage is not suitable for storing critical or persistent data. If data durability and persistence are required, it is recommended to use Amazon EBS volumes or other durable storage options provided by AWS.


## Yes, both EBS (Elastic Block Store) and instance storage can be used like root volumes on Amazon EC2 instances. Each storage option has its own characteristics and use cases. Here are some key points:


**1. Root Volume:** The root volume is the primary storage for EC2 instances, where the operating system and system files are stored. It is commonly configured as an EBS volume, but the choice of storage for the root volume depends on the EC2 instance types.

**2. EBS:**  EBS volumes provide durable and persistent block-level storage. They can be attached to EC2 instances and are suitable for storing data that needs to persist even when the instance is stopped or terminated. EBS volumes can be easily backed up, resized, and have various performance and durability options.


**3.Instance Storage:** Instance storage, also known as ephemeral storage, is temporary block level storage that is directly attached to the host machine running the EC2 instance. It offers high performance and low latency. However, the data stored on instance storage is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated, or if there is an underlying hardware failure.


**4. Use Cases:** EBS volumes are commonly used for storing data that requires durability and persistence, such as application data, databases, and file systems. Instance storage is suitable for temporary storage needs, caching, temporary files, and workloads that can tolerate data loss or can regenerate data.


It's important to choose the appropriate storage option based on your specific requirements for data 
durability, persistence, performance, and cost.

## File storage

+ Cloud file storage is a method for storing data in the cloud that provides servers and applications access to data through shared file systems.

+ This compatibility makes cloud file storage ideal for workloads that rely on shared file systems and provides simple integration without code changes.

+ There are many file storage solutions that exist, ranging from a single node file server on a compute instance using block storage as the underpinnings with no scalability or few redundancies to protect the data, to a do-it-yourself clustered solution, to a fully-managed solution.


# EBS Backed EC2 INSTANCES -:

An "EBS-backed" EC2 instance refers to an Amazon EC2 instance that uses an Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume as its root volume. In this configuration, the root volume, which contains the operating system and system files, is stored on an EBS volume.


## Here are some key points about EBS-backed EC2 instances:

**1. Root Volume:** The root volume is the primary storage for an EC2 instance and typically holds the operating system and boot files. In the case of an EBS-backed instance, the root volume is an EBS volume.


**2. Durability and Persistence:** EBS volumes are durable and persist even when the EC2 instance is stopped or terminated. This means that the data on the root volume remains intact, and you can start a new EC2 instance using the same EBS volume.


**3. Snapshot and Backup:** EBS-backed instances allow you to create snapshots of the EBS volumes, which provide a point-in-time backup of the data. These snapshots can be used to restore or create new EBS volumes, enabling data recovery and cloning of instances.


**4. Flexible Volume Management:** EBS volumes can be easily resized and modified without impacting the running EC2 instance. You can increase the size of the root volume, change its volume type, or attach additional EBS volumes as needed.


**5. Instance Type Compatibility:**  Most EC2 instance types support EBS-backed instances. When launching an EC2 instance, you can select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that is configured to use an EBS volume as the root device.


**6. Performance and Availability:** EBS-backed instances offer a reliable and scalable storage solution with configurable performance options. You can choose different EBS volume types based on your application's performance requirements.EBS-backed instances are the recommended approach for most use cases, as they provide greater 
flexibility, durability, and ease of management compared to instance-store-backed instances.

**AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS)** is a block-level storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for use with EC2 instances. It offers durable and persistent block storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances, providing reliable storage for your applications and data.

## Resources and tags

+ Amazon EC2 provides different resources that you can create and use.

+ Some of these resources include images, instances, volumes, and snapshots. When you create a resource, we assign the resource a unique resource ID.

+ Some resources can be tagged with values that you define, to help you organize and identify them.

## Recycle Bin

+ Recycle Bin is a data recovery feature that enables you to restore accidentally deleted Amazon EBS snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs.

+ When using Recycle Bin, if your resources are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle Bin for a time period that you specify before being permanently deleted.
