## **1. Block Storage:**

+  Block storage is a type of data storage that is used to store data in fixed-sized blocks or chunks.

+  Each block is treated as an individual hard drive, and they can be individually formatted with file systems.
+  Unlike file storage, which organizes data hierarchically using directories and folders,
   block storage does not organize data into a hierarchical structure and is typically used for raw storage purposes.





### **Types of Block Storages in AWS:**
   

Amazon Web Services provide two types of Block Storages, they are
   

-  **Instance Store(temporary)**
     
-  **Elastic Block Storage(permanent)**


---


### **Instance Store:**



![INSTANCE STORE](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/0f5cde3c-663f-487b-97da-b1eaf4038745)



+  An instance store provides **temporary block-level storage** for your instance.

+  This storage is located on disks that are **physically** attached to the host computer.
+  Volatile, temporary storage that is attached to your instances & It is only **present during the running lifetime of the instance.**
+  The size of an instance store and the number of available devices varies by **instance type.**
+  Instance store is dedicated to a particular instance, the disk subsystem is shared among instances on a host computer.
+  Instance store volumes do not their own management application programming interface (API).
+  You cannot make an instance store volume available after you launch the instance.




### **Use-Case:**

   -  AWS instance store volumes work well for temporary storage of information that is continually changing, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content.
     
   -  You can also use them for data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load balanced pool of web servers.





### **How the Instance Store Works:**


+  An Amazon EC2 instance running with an attached instance store.

+  The instance has been stopped or terminated.


![image 2](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/0c23d4fa-1272-4c46-8f57-ff192d36b6c4)


+  All data on the attached instance store is deleted when the instance is stopped or terminated.

### **Elastic Block Storage(EBS):**


![EBS2](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/bb9e7da9-8ebb-4969-a141-2c63727de557)




+  Amazon Elastic Block Storage provides **persistent block-storage volumes** for use with EC2 instances.

+  It is also known as **on-volatile storage** because it retains data even after power to that device is shut off.
+  Each EBS volume is **automatically replicated within its Availability Zone** to protect against component failure, offering **high availability and durability.**
+  With Amazon EBS, you can scale your usage up or down within minutesâ€”all while paying only for the resources that you provision.
+  To achieve an even higher level of data durability, you can utilize Amazon EBS to **create point-in-time snapshots of your volumes,** a feature known as **EBS Snapshots.**
+  Additionally, you can recreate a new volume from a snapshot at any time, share snapshots, or even copy snapshots to different AWS Regions for enhanced **Disaster Recovery (DR) protection.**
+  An EBS snapshot functions as **an incremental backup.** In the initial backup of a volume all the data is copied, Subsequent backups only
   save the blocks of data that have changed since the latest snapshot.



![EBS_SNAP](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/129171351/300b5710-1b87-423a-884d-9755ef8df518)






### **Use-Cases:**


+  EBS provides scalable and durable storage for database files, supporting relational and NoSQL databases on Amazon EC2 instances.
   It enables dynamic adjustments in size and performance, along with reliable backup solutions using EBS snapshots.

   
+  EBS is utilized for high-performance applications, including real-time analytics and simulations, offering low-latency and consistent I/O performance.
   Users can select EBS volume types like Provisioned IOPS to meet specific throughput and IOPS requirements.
