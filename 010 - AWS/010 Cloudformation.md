# AWS CloudFormation

![cf1](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/77039703/bda44155-c2ea-4bc3-ba17-30cee080a6a9)
+ AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.
  
+ You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.
   
+ You don't need to individually create and configure AWS resources and figure out what's dependent on what; CloudFormation handles that.

## Benefits 

1. Deployment speed

2. Scaling up

3. Service integration

4. Consistency

5. Security

6. Easy updates

## Cloudformation Concepts

When you use AWS CloudFormation, you work with templates and stacks. You create templates to describe your AWS resources and their properties.

1. Templates

2. Stacks

3. Change sets

## Templates

+ A CloudFormation template is a JSON or YAML formatted text file.

+ You can save these files with any extension, such as .json, .yaml, .template, or .txt.

+ CloudFormation uses these templates as blueprints for building your AWS resources. For example, in a template, you can describe an Amazon EC2 instance, such as the instance type, the AMI ID, block device mappings, and its Amazon EC2 key pair name.

+ Whenever you create a stack, you also specify a template that CloudFormation uses to create whatever you described in the template.

## Example Template format
    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
    Description: A sample template
    Resources:
      MyEC2Instance:
        Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
        Properties:
          ImageId: ami-0ff8a91507f77f867
          InstanceType: t2.micro
          KeyName: testkey
          BlockDeviceMappings:
            - DeviceName: /dev/sdm
              Ebs:
                VolumeType: io1
                Iops: 200
                DeleteOnTermination: false
                VolumeSize: 20



# Stacks

+ When you use CloudFormation, you manage related resources as a single unit called a stack.

+ You create, update, and delete a collection of resources by creating, updating, and deleting stacks.

+ All the resources in a stack are defined by the stack's CloudFormation template.

+ Suppose you created a template that includes an Auto Scaling group, Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, and an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database instance.

+ To create those resources, you create a stack by submitting the template that you created, and CloudFormation provisions all those resources for you.

## Change sets

+ If you need to make changes to the running resources in a stack, you update the stack.

+ Before making changes to your resources, you can generate a change set, which is a summary of your proposed changes.

+ Change sets allow you to see how your changes might impact your running resources, especially for critical resources, before implementing them.

### Example

+ if you change the name of an Amazon RDS database instance, CloudFormation will create a new database and delete the old one.

+ You will lose the data in the old database unless you've already backed it up.

+ If you generate a change set, you will see that your change will cause your database to be replaced, and you will be able to plan accordingly before you update your stack.

## How does cloudformation works

+ When creating a stack, AWS CloudFormation makes underlying service calls to AWS to provision and configure your resources.

+ CloudFormation can only perform actions that you have permission to do.

+ For example, to create EC2 instances by using CloudFormation, you need permissions to create instances.

+ You'll need similar permissions to terminate instances when you delete stacks with instances.

+ You use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage permissions.

+ The calls that CloudFormation makes are all declared by your template.

## Template Anatomy

A template is a JSON- or YAML-formatted text file that describes your AWS infrastructure.

    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "version date"

    Description:
      String

    Metadata:
      template metadata

    Parameters:
      set of parameters

    Rules:
      set of rules

    Mappings:
      set of mappings

    Conditions:
      set of conditions

    Transform:
      set of transforms

    Resources:
      set of resources

    Outputs:
      set of outputs



## Format Version

The AWSTemplateFormatVersion section (optional) identifies the capabilities of the template. The latest template format version is 2010-09-09 and is currently the only valid value.

### JSON

    "AWSTemplateFormatVersion" : "2010-09-09"

### YAML 

    AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"

## Description

+ The Description section (optional) enables you to include comments about your template.

+ The value for the description declaration must be a literal string that is between 0 and 1024 bytes in length

### JSON

    "Description" : "Here are some details about the template."

### YAML 
    
    Description: > Here are some details about the template.

## Metadata

You can use the optional Metadata section to include arbitrary JSON or YAML objects that provide details about the template.

### JSON

    "Metadata" : {
      "Instances" : {"Description" : "Information about the instances"},
      "Databases" : {"Description" : "Information about the databases"}
    }

### YAML 

    Metadata:
      Instances:
        Description: "Information about the instances"
      Databases: 
        Description: "Information about the databases"

### Meta keys

+ AWS::CloudFormation::Init

+ AWS::CloudFormation::Interface

+ AWS::CloudFormation::Designer

## Parameters

Use the optional Parameters section to customize your templates. Parameters enable you to input custom values to your template each time you create or update a stack.

### Example 

declare a parameter named InstanceTypeParameter. This parameter lets you specify the Amazon EC2 instance type for the stack to use when you create or update the stack. Note that InstanceTypeParameter has a default value of t2.micro.

### JSON

    "Parameters" : {
      "ParameterLogicalID" : {
        "Type" : "DataType",
        "ParameterProperty" : "value"
      }
    }
  
### YAML 

    Parameters:
      ParameterLogicalID:
        Type: DataType
        ParameterProperty: value

## Rules

+ The optional Rules section validates a parameter or a combination of parameters passed to a template during a stack creation or stack update. To use template rules, explicitly declare Rules in your template followed by an assertion. 

+ A rule can include a RuleCondition property and must include an Assertions property.

### Rule specific intrinsic functions

To define a rule condition and assertions, use rule-specific intrinsic functions, which are functions that can only be used in the Rules section of a template. You can nest functions, but the final result of a rule condition or assertion must be either true or false.

+ Fn::And

+ Fn::Contains

+ Fn::EachMemberEquals

+ Fn::EachMemberIn

+ Fn::Equals

+ Fn::If

+ Fn::Not

+ Fn::Or

+ Fn::RefAll

+ Fn::ValueOf

+ Fn::ValueOfAll 

## Mappings

+ The optional Mappings section matches a key to a corresponding set of named values. 

+ For example, if you want to set values based on a region, you can create a mapping that uses the region name as a key and contains the values you want to specify for each specific region. You use the Fn::FindInMap intrinsic function to retrieve values in a map.

## JSON 

    "Mappings" : {
      "Mapping01" : {
        "Key01" : {
          "Name" : "Value01"
        },
        "Key02" : {
          "Name" : "Value02"
        },
        "Key03" : {
          "Name" : "Value03"
        }
      }
    }

## YAML

    Mappings: 
      Mapping01: 
        Key01: 
          Name: Value01
        Key02: 
          Name: Value02
        Key03: 
          Name: Value03

## Conditions

+ The optional Conditions section contains statements that define the circumstances under which entities are created or configured. 

+ For example, you can create a condition and then associate it with a resource or output so that AWS CloudFormation only creates the resource or output if the condition is true.

## JSON

    "Conditions" : {
      "Logical ID" : {Intrinsic function}
    }

## YAML

    Conditions:
      Logical ID:
        Intrinsic function


## Transform

+ The optional Transform section specifies one or more macros that AWS CloudFormation uses to process your template. The Transform section builds on the simple, declarative language of AWS CloudFormation with a powerful macro system.

+ You can declare one or more macros within a template. AWS CloudFormation executes macros in the order that they're specified. 

+ When you create a change set, AWS CloudFormation generates a change set that includes the processed template content. You can then review the changes and execute the change set.

      Transform:
        - MyMacro
        - 'AWS::Serverless'


## Resources

The required Resources section declares the AWS resources that you want to include in the stack, such as an Amazon EC2 
instance or an Amazon S3 bucket.

## JSON

    "Resources" : {
        "Logical ID" : {
            "Type" : "Resource type",
            "Properties" : {
                Set of properties
            }
        }
    }

## YAML

    Resources:
      Logical ID:
        Type: Resource type
        Properties:
          Set of properties

## Output

The optional Outputs section declares output values that you can import into other stacks (to create cross-stack references), return in response (to describe stack calls), or view on the AWS CloudFormation console. 

## JSON

    "Outputs" : {
      "Logical ID" : {
        "Description" : "Information about the value",
        "Value" : "Value to return",
        "Export" : {
          "Name" : "Name of resource to export"
        }
      }
    }

## YAML

    Outputs:
      Logical ID:
        Description: Information about the value
        Value: Value to return
        Export:
          Name: Name of resource to export

## AWS Cloudformation Designer

+ AWS CloudFormation Designer (Designer) is a graphic tool for creating, viewing, and modifying AWS CloudFormation templates.

+ With Designer, you can diagram your template resources using a drag-and-drop interface, and then edit their details using the integrated JSON and YAML editor.

+ Whether you are a new or an experienced AWS CloudFormation user, AWS CloudFormation Designer can help you quickly see the interrelationship between a template's resources and easily modify templates.

## Benefits

1. Visualize template resources

2. Simplify template authoring

3. Simplify editing with the integrated JSON and YAML editor

## Pricing

+ There is no additional charge for using AWS CloudFormation with resource providers in the following namespaces: AWS::*, Alexa::*, and Custom::*. In these cases, you pay for AWS resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, etc.

+ created using AWS CloudFormation the same as if you had created them manually.

+ You only pay for what you use, with no minimum fees and no required upfront commitments.
