Amazon CloudWatch is a component of Amazon Web Services that provides monitoring for AWS resources and the customer applications running on the Amazon infrastructure.

## What is cloud-Watch

![What-is-AWS-CloudWatch](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/54675124/1a861808-c27c-4f1b-898c-3bc6c793c73c)


**Amazon Cloud Watch** monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use Cloud Watch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications


## What It Does
It Collect, access, and analyze your resource and application data using powerful visualization tools.


![Product-Page-Diagram_Amazon-CloudWatch 095eb618193be7422d2d34e3abd5fdf178b6c0e2](https://github.com/zen-class/zen-class-devops-documentation/assets/54675124/4b93a498-a3da-4b3b-b906-bf7b961efbd9)


Improve operational performance using alarms and automated actions set to activate at predetermined thresholds.

Seamlessly integrate with more than 70 AWS services for simplified monitoring and scalability.

Troubleshoot operational problems with actionable insights derived from logs and metrics in your Cloud Watch dashboards.

## Use Cases
### Monitor application performance
Visualize performance data, create alarms, and correlate data to understand and resolve the root cause of performance issues in your AWS resources.

## Monitoring and Observability and Telemetry

+ Full-stack observability at AWS includes AWS-native, Application Performance Monitoring (APM), and open-source solutions
+ Giving you the ability to understand what is happening across your technology stack at any time. 
+ AWS observability lets you collect, correlate, aggregate, and analyze telemetry in your network, infrastructure, and applications in the cloud, hybrid, or on-premises environments 
+ so you can gain insights into the behavior, performance, and health of your system. These insights help you detect, investigate, and remediate problems faster; and coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning, proactively react, predict, and prevent problems.

## Collect metrics, logs, and traces from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers with the Cloud Watch agent
The unified Cloud Watch agent enables you to do the following:

+ Collect internal system-level metrics from Amazon EC2 instances across operating systems. The metrics can include in-guest metrics, in addition to the metrics for EC2 instances.
+ collect system-level metrics from on-premises servers. These can include servers in a hybrid environment as well as servers not managed by AWS.

+ Retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the StatsD and collectd protocols. StatsD is supported on both Linux servers and servers running Windows Server. collectd is supported only on Linux servers.

+ Collect logs from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, running either Linux or Windows Server.

+ Versions 1.300025.0 and later can collect traces from the AWS X-Ray Open Telemetry auto-instrumentation SDKs and send them to the X-Ray backend.

## Monitor Your Entire AWS Environment More Effectively
